DELIVERY CHARGE FUNCTIONALITY
============================

I've created a text file with the code you need to add to your frmPOS class.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT:
-----------------
1. Open the frmPOS.cs file in Visual Studio
2. Add the two methods from DeliveryChargeCode.txt to your frmPOS class
3. In the Form Designer, double-click on the btnDeliveryChargeAmend button to create the click event handler
4. Replace the empty event handler with the code from the btnDeliveryChargeAmend_Click method

POSTCODE-BASED PRICING:
----------------------
- NE16: £2.50 (Base charge - restaurant's area)
- Nearby areas (NE15, NE17, etc.): £3.00 - £4.50
- Further areas (NE1, NE2, etc.): £5.00 - £7.50
- Maximum charge areas (DH, SR, TS): £8.50 - £10.00

HOW IT WORKS:
-----------
1. When the btnDeliveryChargeAmend button is clicked, it extracts the postcode from the customer's address
2. It calculates the delivery charge based on the postcode area
3. It updates the txtDeliveryCharge textbox with the calculated amount

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
If you get an error about ambiguous method calls:
1. Make sure you've deleted any other DeliveryCharge*.cs files
2. Make sure you don't have duplicate CalculateDeliveryCharge methods in your code
